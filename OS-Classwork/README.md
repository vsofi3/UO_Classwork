# OS-Classwork

This repository includes all the work from my CIS 415 Operating Systems class. The three main projects I worked on are briefly summarized below

**Project 1** -  using C system calls to create a functional command line interface.

**Project 2** -  implementing a round-robin scheduling technique for multiple processes. 

**Project 3** -  implementing a simple, thread-safe publisher/subscriber model using a circular buffer.
