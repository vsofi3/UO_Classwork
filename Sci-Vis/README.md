# Sci-Vis

This repository includes my work from my Scientific Visualization class, taught by professor Hank Childs at the University of 
Oregon. The primary tools of this class was the VTK library and VisIt. Some topics that were covered include interpolation, coloring,
isosurfacing, advection, and marching tetrahedrons. I have decided to mostly include just the project code itself, 
the data and instructions for each project can be found on the course website.

For my final project, I used VisIt to create an animation visualizing the average January temperature across the globe from 1954 - 2018.
